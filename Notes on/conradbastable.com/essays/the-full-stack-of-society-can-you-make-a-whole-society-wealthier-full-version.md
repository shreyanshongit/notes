* ### Under the Feudal System {#under-the-feudal-system}

  * #### For thousands of years the only way to societal wealth was working on the land owned by your lord. {#for-thousands-of-years-the-only-way-to-societal-wealth-was-working-on-the-land-owned-by-your-lord.}

  * #### Technologies stagnated, therefore the value of the land remained relatively static, mirroring its productivity from a millenia back. {#technologies-stagnated,-therefore-the-value-of-the-land-remained-relatively-static,-mirroring-its-productivity-from-a-millenia-back.}

    * (Un-related commentary: The reasons behind demise of the feudal system in Europe were exogenous shocks which broke the local equilibrium,   
      * the Black Death which altered the labor dynamics unfathomably, given the population was so heavily decimated that it inverted the bargaining power, forcing the land owners to provide the labour with better terms, giving rise to a wage-price system.   
      * The other shock were the shipments of silver from the New World to the capital-starved Europe, leading to inflation, which eroded the real income of the land owners, while causing the subsequent rise and capital accumulation of the bourgeoisie due to appreciating value of the movable goods (example: inventories held by merchants)).

  * #### As for any surplus wealth, it was consumed back by the population, given there were no fertile opportunities for investment of any surplus wealth. {#as-for-any-surplus-wealth,-it-was-consumed-back-by-the-population,-given-there-were-no-fertile-opportunities-for-investment-of-any-surplus-wealth.}

    * It must be made clear that there is practically no reality in which the peasantry would make surplus wealth. But, even if one did manage to realize such an insurmountable feat, they would certainly fail at investing it at productive opportunities, as THE main source of the societal wealth, was Land, and land is not for sale, it never was, it’s owned by your feudal lord, and you are inextricably bound to it. Also, your fee to be able to work on this land might be increased tomorrow, so get back to work.   
    * Thus, *“Wealth generated has nowhere productive to go, which means it cannot be compounded. Only consumed.”*  
    * You as a peasant would see the only land you see, for the rest of your life, as had your parents, grandparents, grand grandparents and so on, and so will your kids, theirs and so on. Any surplus wealth generated had nowhere productive to go, therefore it couldn’t be compounded, only consumed \=\> Zero-surplus subsistence living.

  * ####  The game of wealth generation under the Feudal system was binary, i.e. Serfdom or Violence. {#the-game-of-wealth-generation-under-the-feudal-system-was-binary,-i.e.-serfdom-or-violence.}

    * One had to take the wealth. Conquer it, assert ownership, and force their will (taxes).  
    * The source was land, all the land was owned, and never for sale, so the only means to acquire wealth was violence. Therefore, to advance in the feudal society, beyond the subsistence living, had to spill blood.  
    * *“(killing is bad) but not playing the game doesn’t free you from the consequences of others playing. And they will play. ”*  
    * The name of the game is taxation-of-the-same-fixed-wealth-generating-resource.  
    * Every feudal dynasty’s story began with a peasant spilling blood, and rallying the locals together.  
    * To compound your wealth, you invest in Blood and Iron. Any lord who gets a slight advantage over their neighbors in either Blood or Iron, is able to snowball that, by conquering their neighbors, and investing back in Blood and Iron, and the cycle repeats.You have no other way but to invest in means to take wealth from others.  
      * And, if you’re ethically constrained, then, you still need to invest in Blood and Iron, and snowball, so you could protect your wealth, from your lesser ethical neighbors.

  * #### Feudalism today: {#feudalism-today:}

    * Today the path towards upward mobility of labor is being significantly impeded, due to the introduction of the Software layer. This phenomenon is evident as the full-time employees of Uber or Airbnb working at world class office spaces (above the software layer) are completely disconnected from the contractors (below the software layer) who are the drivers or the hosts. The workers below this software layer, have no opportunity for the world-class on-the-job training and development, or career advancements enjoyed by the workers above the software layer. There’s this massive gap, and no obvious way to cross it. And, as the software layer gets thicker and thicker, the gap widens between the ones above and the ones below it.  
    * Optimistic take: people get to work more flexibly than ever before in history, they get to exchange their free time, maybe put their otherwise stationary assets to use (cars, bikes, homes) much more flexibly.  
    * Pessimistic take: this leads to the zero-sum game as seen during the feudal times. When the labor becomes the peasant, he is no longer able to even afford to acquire the very tools that are used by him to accomplish a task, or do his work.Instead what he must do then, is, rent it from his “feudal lord” (the Company/the Platform/the Employer (the owner of the software layer)), and pay them an ever-increasing “lease”/“fee”/“feu” to be able to feed himself and his family.  
    * The marginal cost of production has been rendered to negligible due to influence of the software layer, highlighting that the software companies do not need as many people to retain their enterprise or build it, meaning lesser opportunities for upwards mobility on top of obstructed or non-obvious pathways.  
    * Iron \= Software, Warriors \= Programmers  
    * Labor comes in perfect competition territory.

* ### Mercantilism {#mercantilism}

  * #### *“**Wealth could be created from Trade** led to new and more successful ways of building Wealth. (That bold part still manages to confuse many non-economists today)”*  {#“wealth-could-be-created-from-trade-led-to-new-and-more-successful-ways-of-building-wealth.-(that-bold-part-still-manages-to-confuse-many-non-economists-today)”}

    * I had to find out why this (the bold part) confuses many non-economists, so I went down the rabbit hole.  
      * The “fixed pie” fallacy  
        * Many non-economists mistakenly assume that actual physical production of tangible goods \= wealth, when, in reality, the production could be of services which are intangible, which confuses the non-economists as they perceive “no tangible output.” Consequently this leads to the belief that wealth is fixed, implying that one’s gain from trade is at the expense of the other, as there had been “no addition/expansion of the pie” (A Zero-sum game, when in all reality trade is a positive-sum game).  
      * focus on production vs. exchange  
        * Many non-economists believe that,   
      * visible losers, invisible winners  
      * mis-understanding of comparative advantage  
      * distinction between money and wealth
