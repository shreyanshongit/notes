## Productivity

1. Become a sera tasker, deep focus on a single task, at one time, with no room for bg processing of any other task.

Turn off the internet before bed 2. Keep it off for at least the first hour of the day, and try not to break the momentum, the flow. 2. Begin working immediately after waking. It's amazing how clear my head feels when I don't fill it with nonsense. By working it means shower, exercise, yoga, skincare + work. 3. When you work for a few days, then you lose the “motivation”, you’re doing it wrong. Do yourself a favour and look up discipline instead of motivation. Trust me, bro, I was just like you, but nothing is as good as discipline. At one stage, you completely forget about motivation and become independent of it...speaking from experience.

1. Make your year 8 weeks, i.e. do what you would do in a year, but just in 8 weeks, then take a week off if you wish to.
2. Just remember you have 4000 weeks in total in your life, and you’ve already done 22.5% of your life, so you don’t have time to waste.
3. Stop watching any other content aside from podcasts, self-help, entrepreneurship, business, geopolitics, educational, and reaction videos.
4. Dare touch Social Media, i.e. don’t dare scroll Instagram at all, or YT Shorts. It’s doom scrolling.
5. “You see… The problem is that you think you have time…”

## Studying

### Cramming/Learning

1. Play a playlist in the background with low volume.
2. Check the syllabus, and check the weightages.
3. Solve a SQP.
4. Now, fill a table like this in your notebook.

||Light Exam Weight|Heavy Exam Weight|
|---|---|---|
|Strength|||
|Weakness|||

Then write down all the topics / chapters from high to low on basis of how many periods would they take. Then as per the data you classified in the above table prioritize on basis of periods that is supposed to take.

[what are periods in cbse syllabus - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+periods+in+cbse+syllabus&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN1056IN1056&oq=What+a&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgYIARBFGDkyBggCEEUYPDIGCAMQRRg8MgYIBBBFGDwyBggFEEUYQTIGCAYQRRhBMgYIBxBFGEHSAQgyNjIyajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

This will help prioritization. And, if none of the chapters are really strength, then use relative to each other.

1. Blurt out everything you know of every chapter as per your priorities.
2. Read the name of chapter you’re going to revise/learn.
3. Go back of the textbook or check the internet for questions on that chapter (don’t see answers). You can just go to CBSE syllabus when applicable, and check units, each unit have several questions provided in the document.
4. Now read intro, and the conclusion.
5. Now, read all headings, and all things which have been bold, recalling questions related to it.
6. Skim the chapter.
7. Create a mind map, and verify it using google, if you suspect something.

[https://www.edrawmind.com/article/tony-buzan-biography.html](https://www.edrawmind.com/article/tony-buzan-biography.html)

1. Exercise.
2. Sleep.

- Don’t read and memorize single sentences, but instead whole paragraphs.
- Keep referencing heading or title while reading text under a given heading. For example: - “In Consumer Protection, this is about Concept of Consumer Protection.” - “Consumer under modern concept is treated as king, and the Producers produce goods and render services as per consumer’s needs and wants.”
- Use the hell out of Mnemonics.
- Use the hell out of Mindmaps.
- Use self-questioning.
- Try to get an audiobook, if not then a course on your chapter, maybe from YouTube, listen to them topic by topic for chapter, then see your book again.
- Forgetting curve must be taken care of, if you have enough time.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)

- Never multitask when receiving inputs for learning, but maximize output when learning, i.e. teach others, explain to others as much as you can.
- Best trick in the book - Places, create a story to learn anything, write that story in english, and revise in hindi and hinglish.

### Remembering things

Write down what you want to remember in a flashcard, or a journal or register, without looking at core source, write it like a personal letter, and create a story, draw a pic if you can.

### A system from reddit (modified)

- Organize every assignment you have in order of when it's due. Make note of every exam. Don't get blindsided. There is NO coming back from that.

---

- Don't fall behind on your readings. There's no coming back from that, either.

---

- If you don't have anything due at the moment, work on it anyways. Whatever assignment is already available on D2L is something you should be working on. The more time you have, the better the quality of your work.

---

- Don’t miss classes.

---

- Don’t forget compounding effects, your small little decision like not playing Netflix today or right now, and instead study, or work, will create the big difference, and a big fortress or moat to protect your and your family’s future.

---

- Don't do school and fun stuff in the same place. Whenever I'm on campus, I don't even so much as play games on my phone. I'm either in class or working somewhere quiet on a project or assignment. At home, I have a desk set up. When I finish an assignment and I wanna watch something on my laptop, I move somewhere else. Now, whenever I'm on campus or at my desk, my brain goes into focus mode. I never get distracted while working, even for multiple hours. So take this seriously. DON'T DO SCHOOL AND FUN STUFF IN THE SAME PLACE.

---

- The reason I stress #4 so much is because come reading week, the temptation to relax and do nothing will be damn near irresistible. I myself have fallen prey to it many times. AND IT ALWAYS COSTS ME. Reading week is there for a reason, and it's not to have fun. It's to catch up on readings, study for exams, or get started on major assignments. All of which is much harder to do when you sit down and work but keep getting distracted every five minutes. Trust me. #4 is more important than you think. If you don't follow #4, you can't follow #5, and your grades will suffer as a result. Whether by a lot or a little, they will suffer nonetheless.

---

- Answer questions in class, ask questions in class, ENGAGE DURING THE LECTURE. This has an incredibly positive impact on your retention of the material and makes a good impression on your professor.

---

- The best way to study material for exams is to make questions out of your notes. For example:

1. Notes: "A business's first priority should be providing value to its customers." Make a question out of this.
2. Question: "Out of all stakeholders that a business has, including shareholders, investors, customers, employees, and the community, who is most important?"
3. Whether you're making up questions for your study group to answer or you're answering questions they come up with, either one reinforces your knowledge better than mindlessly memorizing the content.
4. You can also use the end-of-chapter questions or answer the learning objectives in a chapter. I swear, after using this method, I'll literally just reread my notes on the train on my way to campus and I'll score a 90 on the exam just because I know the material that well.

---

- Get proper sleep. People think they can get by on fewer hours. First of all, it affects how well you can focus. Second of all, with longer readings, at some point, you'll just stop comprehending or processing what you're reading. This is usually when you take a break. However, if you're sleep-deprived, the problem won't get fixed no matter how many breaks you take. So get proper sleep. If not for the sake of your health, then for the sake of your grades.

---

- Also, set aside time out of your day to have fun. School is important but you can't afford burnout. The best way to avoid burnout is to set aside time for fun. And you'll only have time to set aside if you don't fall behind. And you won't fall behind if you follow every single tip from the above. And I really do mean EVERY SINGLE ONE. Don't think you can skip the sleeping one or that you can catch up on readings. I'm currently trying to catch up on readings and, while possible, it's utter hell. I'm giving you these tips based on my past failures. Heed them well, young grasshopper.

---

- Go to office hours, book tutoring or writing support if needed, and ask for help before it's too late. I struggle with this constantly because I keep thinking I can do it if I just work harder. It's one thing to work hard. It's another thing to work SMART. And you should be doing the latter.
    - Two guys work in construction. One guy completes the job in 6 hours. The other completes the job in 40 minutes. When the first guy asks the second guy how he did the work so fast, the other guy tells him he was using the wrong tool.
    - Effort is useless if you don't apply it correctly. Book support or tutoring if you need it. Failing an exam and then doing the same thing again with more effort doesn't make you hardworking. It makes you stupid. I tell myself that all the time in hopes it'll get through my thick skull. Ask for help if you don't understand something.

## Business

### Retailing

### India Focused

> Jiske paas paise nahi hote, wo kam khareed ke bachata hai; jiske paas paise hote hain, wo zyada khareed ke bachata hai. - Damodar Mall (CEO of Reliance Retail.)

> Income increases in India are recent, meaning higher purchasing capacity, but we have lower spending habits.

### Reliance Retailing

1. What's new in the store this time.
2. What's on sale in the store this time.
3. Customers enter the store with a shopping list in mind based on their needs.
4. The store is designed to disrupt the shopping list by strategically placing impulse buys and categories throughout the store.
5. **Targeting the primary customer: the homemaker**, who is likely working and has school-going children.
6. The goal is to make the shopper feel free from the restrictions of their shopping list, encouraging them to discover new products and ultimately feeling good about their purchases while saving money.
7. **Upselling through value perception:** The stores present even premium products as good value through bundling and deals. Reliance states, "We are continuously selling more premium products, each one of them wrapped in value."
8. **Encouraging trial and discovery:** The stores are designed to make customers comfortable trying new things. For example, the soap section is designed to make it seem like everyone is buying Dove, even though other options are available.
9. Customers are encouraged to purchase cold drinks without waiting for guests.
10. Private label brands are offered alongside national brands to provide a wider variety and cater to different customer needs.
11. **Building a pantry mentality:** Reliance argues that Indian consumers tend to under-consume across categories and emphasizes the importance of stocking up on essentials like detergent and biscuits, stating, "We consume less detergent than our Asian peers...we use fewer personal care products."
12. There's a difference between supermarket customers and super app customers in India.
13. Consumers in supermarket India have higher purchasing capacity but lower purchasing habits. They are more likely to be influenced by in-store nudges and suggestions.
14. Reliance surprisingly sells large variants of products, like they sell more Nutri Choice than Goodday or Parle-G, and that too in 1kg packets, where 60% of consumers are new to it. This means consumers in supermarket India are willing to experiment with new products and larger packs, unlike the general perception of Indian consumers being value-conscious.
15. Data shows that supermarket India is a different segment from general India, and their consumption behavior is distinct.
16. Adaptation in India is done not through single large packets but instead by packaging together smaller units, i.e., creating a pack or bag where multiple small sachets of chips or chocolates are sold together. Reliance sells most of its cornflakes this way and has used this strategy with many manufacturers.
17. Reliance loves bundling, bagging, and packing small items together, resulting in larger purchases.
18. The advantage of being a retailer is that you'll know the results of implementing plans within a week.
19. Product quality is the religion of consumer companies, and companies and individuals who try to cut corners, sacrificing quality, need to be trimmed out.
20. Reliance tells suppliers who have built production capacity to fulfill Diwali demands for sweets like rasgulla and gajar halwa, to work on marginal costs and make single-serve variants that can be sold year-round, like single rasgulla or single-serve gajar halwa, similar to how chocolates or ice cream are sold as single-serve items. The aim is to remove the weight or volume perception from sweets, as people don't say, "I am buying a 20g chocolate," but they say, "I am buying 1kg of Kaju katli."
21. Reliance encourages using by-products to add value wherever possible and sell to consumers.
22. Reliance aims to transform commoditized things into premium products, like rebranding lassi as "Mango Lassi" to make it a premium product where price doesn't matter as much, similar to how coconut juice was repackaged into a premium-looking bottle and became bigger than Mazza.
23. Reliance sees little difference in consumption patterns between towns with a population of 1 million and those with a population of 50 million.
24. Reliance finds small towns with populations between 50,000 and 1,000,000 to be amazing markets.
25. Many startups fail to realize that income increases in Indian markets are phenomenal, and therefore, they need to continuously plan for the future, as the ground is not steady. While they can copy supply chains, they cannot copy-paste retailing strategies.
26. India is so diverse that Reliance had been selling 75 varieties of rice, and when the TESCO team advised them to sell only the top 3 varieties everywhere, the Indian homemaker would reject the entire store, especially in coastal and southern Indian states, including Maharashtra. They are stubborn about their choices and would be upset if they cannot find their preferred rice or other products. For example, serums may be better than hair oil, but homemakers would reject the suggestion.
27. While the aggregate value would not reduce, the share of premium products would grow smaller and smaller in Indian markets, but they would maintain value as the overall market continuously grows bigger and bigger.
28. India is not a "Do-It-Yourself" country but rather a "Do-It-For-Me" country. For example, people would buy IRCTC tickets from a cybercafe but not try themselves, even though IRCTC has been offering online ticketing services for 20 years. IRCTC recognizes the existence of cybercafes and gives them a small commission for assisting with ticket bookings. Indians even pay someone to dispense coffee at train stations instead of doing it themselves.
29. We mustn't confine our meaning of terms or words to Western definitions.
    1. For example, why don't we call this ecommerce or modern retailing:
        - The homemaker sends a list of items she needs via WhatsApp to their local kirana store.
        - The kirana store owner procures all the items and checks for substitutions, contacting the homemaker if needed.
        - Someone is tasked with delivering the items to the homemaker.
        - The homemaker receives the products and pays via UPI or cash within 30 minutes.
        - All this occurs without cash burn.
30. If essentials are on sale, the homemaker would let her guard down and spend even what she intended to save because she is not saving but playing a game called "saving-saving."
31. It would take a normal store 3 months to change customers' behavior and habits successfully. If you can retain customers for 3 months, you've won. A customer checks your store for 3 months.
32. Once an idea works and the pilot is successful, Reliance expands it quickly, ten-fold or thirty-fold in no time.
33. (Continuing from 17:40)
34. When a homemaker travels all the way to a Reliance store, she has crossed numerous options for convenient shopping, ranging from super apps to kirana stores and other stores along the way. She has rejected all of them to come to the Reliance store. It's like a pilgrimage, where God is everywhere (kirana stores, super apps), but people still make an effort to travel to the holy site because the size of the blessing is higher, making the trip worthwhile. So, Reliance marts are in the business of offering a higher blessing, making the trip worthwhile by providing learning and discovery of things the homemaker might not have known otherwise.
35. Reliance grocery stores display "Sugar @ Rs. 9" in big fonts as soon as one enters the store. This 1kg of sugar is priced at Rs. 9 if the customer buys Rs. 1999 worth of goods. This hooks the customer, so if their bill is around Rs. 1700, they'll likely spend over Rs. 2000 to avail of that offer.
36. After entering the supermarket part, nothing is priced at exact multiples of 10, but instead, items are priced like "for 99" or "for 49," creating a mishmash, with items changing frequently.
37. Here's a typical experience at a Reliance neighborhood store:
    1. Upon entry, see "Rs. 9/kg sugar on Rs. 1999 minimum purchase" offer.
    2. Buy one, get one free offers.
    3. "Pick any for Rs. 99" (usually containers, body care creams, sanitary pads, perfumes, and home fragrances).
    4. "Pick any for Rs. 49" (hand wash, home cleaning products, hair color).
    5. "Shop Oreo, get a chance to win a cricket kit" (promotion for the World Cup).
    6. Customers have to bend down to pick up or see some items, but when they get up, they get another look at what was on the top shelves and might consider purchasing those items.
    7. The Customer Decision Tree (CDT) strategy is heavily followed, curating a specific CDT experience.
    8. Reliance broke the brand block strategy for baby care products, grouping all S-size diapers together, regardless of brand, with XL sizes next to them, etc.
    9. In some sections, like the deodorant aisle, Reliance doesn't directly mention the brand they want customers to buy (e.g., "Buy Nivea Deodorant"). Instead, they use color coding and strategically place models using the desired brand without mentioning the brand name.
38. Reliance doesn't use private labels like "Reliance Great Value," "Reliance Diapers," or "Reliance Bhujia." Instead, they create brand names like "Mothercare" and "SnacPack" to maintain a premium experience and establish more brands for India.
39. Reliance always wants the homemaker to be in a "swamver mode," flirting and experimenting, trying, and discovering new products, which is why they broke the brand block model.
40. Shopping at Reliance is not just for convenience but for fun and discovery.
41. There are many "buy one, get one free" offers.
42. At Reliance, the merchandise team, format team, and store owners work together, with 20% of the space dedicated to the store team's discretion on how to sell products.
43. Reliance is not ashamed to call out prices.
44. To encourage larger pack sizes from brands like Britannia and Parle, Reliance works with one brand first, and once successful, the other brands follow suit with potentially better products. Mtlb brittania nhi kr rha, parle ko bol do, britannia jhk maar ke krega aur behtr krega.
45. Now, customers have various choices, even the choices you might not like, but you’re not buying for yourself but your customer.
46. Increasing cart value by “Buy 2 Soap Bars, save Rs. 20.”

- Product ka kaam 4 sbd se jyada ho toh too complicated for consumers.
- Mentality change kro, aisa krna hai ki ticket size bdh jaye, log stock up kre.
- Wo dhnda jha cost of delivery nhi, whi money, mst dnda hai. Jaise brokerage, BNPL, ya koi bhi SAAS.
- Dekho bhai, dukaandar ko bechna alg level muskil hai, toh us samay aisa hota tha ki, Dukandaar apply kiya, fir bank document mangta, 15-20 din mein QR bhejta, jo scale nhi krta. Meine kya kiya, pre made QR liye, gye dukandaar ke paas, link kr diya turn bank se, and whi transaction ussi samay krke aye.
- Jo samne samne khrch hai, woh kyu lena, jaise dukandaar ko baaki log 2% charge krne ki koshsish, kr rhe, humen BharatPe, bol diya hum 0 lenge. Kamayenge kaise? Woh joh data ke upr dukandaar loan le.
- Dekho sb copy krte hai, saare idea, isiliye hr 6 mahine mein flop success koi feature ya product nikaal ke differentiation bnaye rkhni hai.

### Dmart

1. Compares prices with MRP and provides clear discount.

- MRP DMart Rs. 72
- Rs. 399 Rs. 327 Off

1. “Middle class people are low on budget high on empathy”. I.e. word of mouth, they’ll always share their savings, and something good that can be shared to others, and they do not need refferal free from DMart.
2. DMart tries to increase frequency of customer visits, and increase customer base.
3. They move a lot of FMCG goods as these FMCG give quick benefits or gratification to the users, by allowing them to consumer the good they bought with huge savings the same day, instead of 2 days with Amazon.
4. Frugal customer base, i.e. most consumers who shop at DMart go for unbranded or low branded products. For example Tops Ketchup instead of Kissan, which will allow them, when time comes to replace these brands with Private Label.
5. DMart has a great delivery time, they don’t have useless unnecessary coupons, instead they go for direct clear discounts, and a quick fast paced billing experience.

## General

1. Take 10% of your gross profits on every sale and put it in a reserve.
2. Never use the reserve for purposes such as advertisement expenditure, for investments into stock market, or for anything which can wait or can be termed unnecessary.
3. You don't need to make a profit on every single product, but you need to make a profit every single visit by a customer. Attract customers with a cheap product only to sell rest at appropriate margins.
4. Remember their margin is your opportunity, i.e. you don't need to make a lot every unit, instead you can make a lot selling more units, while at the same time reducing potential income of your competitors.
5. Invest such as to make sure you ever sell only if you want to not if you have to. If you often need cash just deposit in a bank, or buy T-Securities.
6. Never go all-in on something, always refrain from purchasing a full position, no matter how much you believe in the business, as if ever the value of it falls, you would die to buy more, but won't be able to.
7. Never be in a hurry to speak, rather take that time to think.
8. Never shy to compensate your employees well, and provide them stability.
9. Never rely on emotions, or confidence in the future to make decisions. Be decisive, but you don't need to make decisions immediately, or you would second guess yourself in the future.
10. Two sales reps are always better than one. Often competitive types, sales reps will try to outdo each other.
11. Use a sense of urgency, and curiosity, excitement, such as by placing a shelf in which every 24 hours you put something up for sale. It'll increase the frequency of store visits, while increasing sales, such as by customers seeing lower prices while he reaches the end.
12. Avoid investments which sound too good to be true. Avoid investments in products by investors who deliver great returns but their strategies could be temporary.
13. Growth is half of the equation, profit is the other half, hence both are equally important.
14. Always remember that more than often high quality companies sell for high prices making them poor investments.
15. People do not buy what you do, they buy why you do it. (Rule of Three Golden Circles - Ted - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&ab_channel=TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&ab_channel=TED))
16. Don't work for the result or riches, work for your dream/goal. Work for they "why you do it". And, make sure everyone who works with you believes in your goal, and mission, and not do this just for the riches, or just the paycheck.
17. Never stop, and enjoy the profits, make sure your company asks itself "Okay, what can I do next?"
18. Remember when people serve themself like checking orders, changing address, or payment method on Amazon, they think service is terrific.
19. No unhealthy competition, bitter rivalry.
20. Strong Fundamentals.
21. Strong control on OpEX.
22. Partner with the Partner, i.e. pay on time and before time to suppliers when possible.
23. Spontaneous Sale, not Sporadic Sale.
24. Compounding Value building is the best thing ever.

## EaseMyTrip

1. No need to promote your USP every time, like see this scenario:
    1. You put your USP everywhere on your site, explicitly like “Sbse sasta, no Delivery fee, no conbvinience fee” tb customer yhi pooche ga n ki khi aur kma rhe hoge, leading to loss in trust. Ab iske jgh us customer ka dost btaye yhi cheez.
    2. Second, ab 0 delivery fee, 0 convenience fee and km convenience fee, ya km delivery fee mein bohot difference hota hai. Kyuki dekho jb koi insaan apne dost ko ya parosi ko bole yha se order kro, ya ticket book kro, km fee lgti hai, he might many times be seen as cheap, but whi agr bole yaha fee nhi lgti, you come out as smart. Like you know the difference between any charge and 0 is infinite, literally.
        1. XYZ Site se kyu order kr rha hai, Bharat Bazaar pe aa, 0 delivery hai.
2. Building a tightly knit ship with very controlled expenses is better than a leaking ship which might sink anytime.
3. Customer centric approach.
4. Feeling pushed to the corner, we had always been the underdog, and had always been cash strapped, so we did things no other OTAs did, such as we made our own call center to increase efficiency and cut in middle men costs, instead of outsourcing.
    1. What this allowed us is to handle unique requests, and ease customer pain, for example:
        1. It’s very common to book wrong tickets, such as on wrong dates, wrong gender, wrong airports, we ease the customer, by saying “We are very sorry to hear about what has happened, but please trust us you’re not alone, 30% people make such mistakes, let us try our best to get your money back, let me write an email to the airline while copying you, to see if money can come back.” now we got a custom CRM, where the Call Center Agent just need to click that “Ask for refund” button, and email automatically populates and is sent requesting for refund, instead of saying “Sorry about that” like our customers.
            1. Reduce Anxiety of the people.
            2. People can take monetary loss, but a loss of ego is a bigger loss, we’re saving their ego, with that first line.
            3. And, that easemytrip has tried on their side, and has emailed the airline.
        2. Now people call in the call center during times of distress, not time of fun or relief, so EaseMyTrip is well aware of customer pain points, and mistake, which their competitors usually are not as well aware of.
        3. What they realized was that a lot of information between call center executive and manager is lost in communication for example:
            1. A Person who booked his first flight, had to go to honeymoon, but his leg got fractured, is now requesting a refund.
            2. Manager is told only - “Sir refund mang rha hai”, meaning ab manager ko toh baaki pta nhi hai ki, uski pehli booking thi, uska honeymoon tha, leg got fractured, and abhi usko paise waps chahiye, and honeymoon pe toh jayega hi baad mein book krke.
            3. So what we did was to make a kitty fund for the call center based on last quarter profit, where the call center agent can issue refund, without going through manager, till that kitty is depleted. Meanwhile, we fight with the airline at the back to get the money back. But customer satisfaction is guranteed. It’s like a marketing budget. This kitty only takes care of exceptional cases, such as above.
        4. Now, there was an exceptional COVID case, suddenly all flights were grounded, cancelled, we had about 230 to 250 crores accumulate profits over last 10 years as cash reserves, we were getting a lot of refund calls like 5 to 6 times usual distress calls to call center, now we used Rs. 130 crore of it to issue refunds to our customers, and lent out Rs. 70 to 80 crores to airlines and hotels, in hopes they won’t go under, and we’ll request them for refunds later, when they get money again, now we were left with just 20 to 30 crores in bank.
            4. Now when July 2020, when travel started to open up again, straight-up as soon as it did, easemytrip jumped from second largest to third largest.
            5. Now people were tweeting and stuff ki @easemytrip ne mere dost ko toh refund de diya, @xyz provider muzhe kb refund dega.
            6. Now, competitors weren't doing anything wrong, cause they didn’t get any money from airlines either, but easemytrip was profitable, and they went an extra mile due to their customer centric focus.
            7. Now such calls, is not expected anymore from EaseMyTrip as they are now a public company.
        5. Unit economics must be very very strong. You must always be making your ship so that like if you receive 6% commission from airlines, make a business which can survive at 5%, not a loss economy.
        6. It worked in easemytrip’s favour that rest of the OTAs such as mmt, yatra, cleartrip, ibibo were so heavily funded, because they never focused on unit economics, did extravagant expenditures on ADs, and outsourced a lot of important things, i.e. loss making, and in-efficiency is breeded into it. Like a few of them had been in biz for 20 years, loss making, being inefficient, which is now in their DNA, in their system, where it becomes extremely hard to change that. It’s easier said than done.
        7. Unit economics must be positive for most business from day one, especially commodity business. But there needs to be extremely high focus on efficiency, and efficiency even if your unit economics aren’t right from day one.
        8. Being more curious than cautious.
        9. Easemytrip was literally in David vs Goliath, the smallest competitor of theirs was funded USD 120 Million, at that time, compared to easemytrip’s 15 lac INR.
        10. Long-term decision making, tough choices, for optimizing for a decade.
            1. Easemytrip was being used by 11,000 travel agents, last 3 years, but easemytrip saw people booking themselves instead of through a travel agent increasingly, so, they knew they had to do B2C, and once they knew they had to, they tried experimenting and asking the agents, getting obvious outrage and opposition. Probably 50% or more of those travel agents would have left easemytrip and this was a huge risk, but potential gains were much larger than the risk.
        11. EaseMyTrip’s wild 93% retention.
            1. Don’t engineer for it, don’t start a loyalty program for first few years.
            2. Customer centrism, no fee.
            3. There’s no customer loyalty word.
            4. There’s instead habituality.
                1. UI/UX which is familiar to customers especially in high ticket business, make them feel ease, and habitual, as they reduce error chances resulting in big losses.
                2. EaseMyTrip target’s family vacations not corporates, why?
                    1. So, convenience fee is charged as a multiple of number of passengers, nobody leaves their comfort in such a business for Rs. 300, but now usually families travel in 3, i.e. they save Rs. 1200, Rs.1800 in convenience fee, and leave their comfort to use easemytrip.
                    2. There’s no use of making all those discount coupons, like go crawl through whole web Honey, CouponDunia, and then ultimately pay equivalent amounts of convenience fee.
                    3. Now customers, know that it’s better to just go directly to easemytripe instead of going through all those sites searching for coupons, and ultimately receiving a worse or equal deal.
        12. The delivery or customer care executive must pickup call in 2 rings and resolve the issue. Somehow it matters a lot. - Lenskart mentioned.
            1. The customer isn’t worried about a delivery being late by 2 days, or 3, but is worried and angry if they’re left uninformed.
            2. Every delivery executive must check the items if they are carrying what they were supposed to deliver, so that the customer isn’t upset of not receiving on day and time they were to receive that specific good.

## A Fund

- Not about what to invest on really, but on how to invest, or suggestions

1. Reserve 40% to 50% of the Fund for the winners.
    1. So you can help them grow further.
    2. So you can maximize your profit.
    3. This would also reduce your problem of deploying too much capital.
2. Purchasing all the infrastructure to be used by the startups.
    4. Example from All-IN pod E171, suppose you got USD 40B Fund, buy up all the cloud credits for GPUs you can, give those credits to startups you wish to invest in, in exchange do a SAFE 7% upfront, and benchmarks to prove they’re doing something valuable.

## Acquihiring ( To prevent anti-trust )

1. Buy up the team of the company.
2. Buy the tech of the company you hired all staff from.

## Stripe

> **Stripe feels almost like a fork of the Kardashev Scale.** Soviet astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed a tiered model for civilization, related to energy usage. Type 1 civilizations could use and store all available energy on their planet, Type 2 civilizations could do the same across their solar system, and Type 3 could manage across their galaxy. According to Kardashev, Earth was a Type 0 civilization, yet to unlock the power of its comely blue dot.
> 
> Other thinkers forked Kardashev’s framework, with Robert Zubrin suggesting the scale could apply to “mastery” of planets and beyond, while Carl Sagan framed it in the context of the information.
> 
> Though startups describe their work as going from “0 to 1,” the meaning of that phrase when applied to Stripe and GPTN holds much greater significance. In seeking to simplify economic engagements around the world, GPTN is fundamentally looking to advance civilization from Type 0 to Type 1. **We are talking about nothing less than planetary finance**.
> 
> Not every product fits within GPTN, of course. Atlas, Capital, Issuing, and other business lines sit outside this central engine but play critical roles in the company’s expansion and counter-positioning.
> 
> - GPTN = Global Payments and Treasury Network

> Stripe _works_. Not only that, but it does so with an elegance that can only come from obsessive devotion and exacting standards. From design to functionality, every aspect of Stripe’s suite seems to have been worried over, honed, polished. Indeed, [one of Stripe’s values](https://newsletter.bringthedonuts.com/p/building-products-at-stripe) is to “really, really care.” You can tell. For goddess sake’s, Stripe’s landing page is not only achingly gorgeous — inspiration for a wave of gradient chasers — but even thoughtful enough to offer an Easter Egg. If you go to [Stripe.com](http://Stripe.com) and enter the old “Konami code” (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A) here’s what you’ll see:

![https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60c6262b639e8c28e8eae3b8_CleanShot](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60c6262b639e8c28e8eae3b8_CleanShot) 2021-06-13 at 11.33.22.gif

> Stripe prides itself on being understaffed, to the point that it is a core principle: "efficiency as leverage.” There is an unsustainable workload and the work pressure on individuals and teams is unreasonable. There is a common feeling of burnout in the company, with workload only increasing since Covid.

> [O]ne thing that’s always impressed me about Stripe is that their CS people always operate as though they’re CEOs. They talk a bit about their lives, talk about the vision of the company, offer to run projections, and offer to negotiate deals to support. I’d like to think that that means we’re a big deal to them, but I’m pretty confident that’s not the case. My support referred to herself as a “payments nerd” and talked about “Patrick” and how he always writes long and thoughtful emails the exact same way he gives interviews.
> 
> What stood out to me...was a sense of autonomy and apparent organisational “flatness”. There is definitely a hierarchy, there are definitely levels, and I’m sure our leadership team wouldn’t want to hear from me every second day but I’m very glad that I don’t feel segmented from others in the company.

> Stripe is the middle-man in a commodity business. How have they managed to evince such adulation?
> 
> As adroitly pointed out by Packy McCormick [in his lovely breakdown of the company](https://www.notboring.co/p/stripe-the-internets-most-undervalued-ec3), **Stripe is a brand with near-universal appeal,** wooing developers, designers, and the rest. No other company in the space gets close. (Square’s Cash App, though only tangentially related, might be an exception, though in a minor key.)
> 
> This comes down to two core reasons. First, Stripe prides itself on its “taste.” Second, **the company is a master of soft power.**
> 
> # **Taste**
> 
> From the start, Stripe had a sense of style. Even its 2011 website is admirably clean and rather appealing.
> 
> This is something Stripe seems to select for when recruiting. Especially in its early days, Stripe asked candidates to come and work with their team for a week or more to get a sense for little details like “taste” that might not show up in interviews.

## Strategy

> The way in which Jeff Bezos has been persistently and continually able to use time horizons as a competitive advantage is something I have deep respect for. There’s something quite deep about the notion of using time horizons as a competitive advantage, in that you’re simply willing to wait longer than other people and you have an organization that is thusly oriented.

Stripe similarly uses time horizons as a competitive advantage. It began by serving an overserved segment of the market -- engineers at startups -- with a product that traded features for simplicity and speed. And it’s grown with them. Like Slack and Snap, Stripe takes advantage of the compounding effects of young users. At an increasing rate, startups become big companies, and young people become decision makers. While incumbents and other competitors focus upmarket, on the most lucrative opportunity in the present, Stripe focuses on compounding over time.

So, Stripe serves the both ends of a customer’s journey, the end where the start begins, i.e. its founding, the point where they’re a startup and the end where they become large i.e. enterprise. Even today, it’s primary focus is startups, why? Because Startups, are poised to disrupt and replace one or more of many of Stripe’s now Enterprise customers.

An ambition that persists long enough to manifest in the material world; articulation with a heartbeat; an idea that can walk. Literature, architecture, music; the Segovian aqueduct, Luxor temple, Ankor Wat. The Palantine Hill.

> What is civilization?
> 
> Light, wrapping darkness.

> And something else, too. The sense of time and timelessness that imbues any of those great monuments. If code and corporations can have that quality

## Sales

1. Don't be stubborn. Accept the results of your test to know of your company is an epic self serve or sales.
2. The sales test is, get the first 50 customers, which are from the void, i.e.you don't approach them, the way they paid you, i.e. themself no sales that's self serve DNA, and it not they're sales. Example: if you got 20 customers through self serve paying you USD 19 each, then you got 20 customers ready to pay you USD 5k, embrace that you're a sales company, and do not reject the existence of latter.
3. B2B ultimately late stage is always a hybrid i.e. not just sales or self-serve.
4. Find a way to close the first 20 customers yourself as a founder, I mean that's like one of the largest selling point for B2Bs, like it's not like a business who calls or talks to other competitors such as Salesforce is gonna be served directly by Marc Benioff, now that would be so exceptional for the business on another end, I mean usually founders can have A+ conversation about their product even if they're not good at closing or opening, just middle part of the sales part. You'll learn so much, which is why you need to do. And, you can be much better than any sales rep you hire ever can, at the middle part.
5. Salesforce like companies have brand, partners, but not there you won't be directly talking to Marc Benioff who can tell you everything.
6. Never hire one sales rep., hire 2, as you gotta A/B test the humans.
7. The first time you're hiring sales, you need to interview 30 sales rep, and go with the ones who can sell your product to you. As founders can ask some great and nuanced questions. Why 30? As atleast 20 of them prob haven't even done research or visited your site, 8 are okay, and 2 are exceptional.
8. Leads are precious don't waste them.
9. Sales people must be preferably quirky.
10. Now after your first 2 sales people, now you can get an experienced sales rep who preferably qualifys other two, so they can tell you what you could do next, to 10x your product.
11. Have a hidden quota before hiring next rep.

# Additional + Summary

First 20 customers then hire sales. Hire 2 sales rep, with 30 interviews. They must be able to sell your product, no necessary sales background, and they maybe quirky, a bit mature. Like if they need give them 10 minute or even a day, and tell them that see i am not good at selling my product myself, and this is not a trick, I just gotta know if you are able to do that, and be happy doing that. VP of Sales when you got like 50 or more reps, na they must sell alongside their sales team. They must carry a bag, i.e. a quota. And, no do not hire a VP who does not like money. Even if they make a mistake, they could be convincing. Ask if the VP is ready to go knocking at leads or customers to serve them. Ask the VP of Sales or Product or marketing etc., what would you do for next 2 weeks if we hire you. And, if they don't say they gonna talk to customers, and if less than 20 customers out. No working on process, or planning for first month or 2 weeks for VPs. And ask them, what can you improve in your customer success story or product.

# **Compensation and Quota**

Compensation and Base salary is usually = 50-50 = together referred to as OTE (On the track earnings) i.e. the max a sales rep can take home. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Many people forget all that matters is if a sales person is closing more than he is taking home. And, in the beginning, when you're just hiring your first few sales reps, just allow them to take 100% commission.

## India’s New Deal

### Establishment of Indian Trade Establishment Institute.

Incorporation of ITEI as a autonomous corporation separate from the Government of India, under the Ministry of Commerce, with its own directors and executives, being appointed not from the government bureaucracy but from appointed from major emerging industrial corporations, major banks, startups, higher level education institutes, and new directors are appointed on recommendation of existing directors.

The purpose of this institute is to establish offices around the globe to provide consultancy and local help to Indian businesses operating or planning for operating in other nations, as well as organize exhibitions and conventions for them in foreign lands, while helping foreign investors better navigate Indian business ecosystem, attracting foreign investment, through local consultancy firms.

It must primarily focus on exports and imports.

It must pay a base salary and prestige to its directors, and incentives for employees as decided by its directors. It’s budget must be set for the whole 5-Y term at once, where it can only be increased when needed, but not decreased, to provide stability.

### Establishment of Indian Global Research Firm.

Incorporation of IGRF as a separate and autonomous corporation.

The purpose of this firm is to allow Indians anywhere in the world, where there exists large Indian diaspora, to work for the advancement of technology, by providing them a safe haven environment, in no matter what country they choose, even if its not India, if there exists a large Indian diaspora there.

It will focus on tech research on technologies which haven’t been discovered, or invented or have been discovered or invented and can be commercialized in next 10 years.

This would not only provide pay, housing, but also, consultancy and support at every step, such as in paper publishing.

The IGRF would also maintain world’s largest digital library of research papers accessible, to anyone, unless restricted by the authors or publishers, in which case the abstracts would be published nonetheless, accessible to anyone anywhere in the world.

The government of India must finance it on 10 Year basis, i.e. a one time grant, every 10 years, as well as its earnings through means where it licenses its technologies or patents or provide other consultancy services such as for I.T., or other tech companies based out of India, planning on expansion into other markets.

### Establishment of National Infrastructure Contractor Credit Corporation.

NICC is to be established as an autonomous corporation under the Ministry of Finance.

Its purpose is to provide guarantee, not collateral, to banks which lend funds to contractors to fulfill orders created by Government Projects or Government Procurement, in order to reduce the problem of delayed or no order fulfillment, in Government projects. Aside from this, it must build itself on government properties allocated to it, or on private lands by acquiring them, factories which are to supply for specific infrastructure projects of the government.

This will encourage lower interests for such borrowers, and better terms overall.

The NICC must pay the bank to which it guaranteed, 20Y low-and-fixed yield NICC Bonds, where it repays the bank for defaulted borrowers which were covered by it, over a 20Y term.

It is to earn its income through government budgets, and through leasing and sale of developed projects.

### Modifications in Tax Regime

- Duty-free import of Capital Goods for the first 3Y of any manufacturing enterprise.
- Re-investment scheme, which is to refund 40% any taxes paid by any corporation that is >10Y old, if they re-invested their 40% profits for a minimum of 5 years.
- Reduction of taxes on manufacturing enterprises which are emerging industries or labour intensive to just 5% for first 5Y.
- Tax-exemption on all manufacturing enterprises, which focus on capital good manufacturing for first 5Y.
- 50% Tax rebates provided to manufacturers who utilize locally manufactured intermediary goods or raw materials.
- Tax rebates on Exports, where 50% GST rebates are to be provided on purchase of inputs, to make exports more competitive.
- Gradual reduction of income taxes to as low as 20% for highest bracket from 30% in a period of 10 Y, if government finances permit it.
- Provide 100% tax-rebate on capital good manufacturers, or tech (non I.T.) companies on their R&D expenditures.

### Reformation of the Indian Education System.

- Decentralization of the Indian Education system from state governed schools to school district based schools, where state appropriates funds to these local units, based on population or enrollment data, and bonus funds based on the scores achieved by such districts. These districts must also be endowed lands. The school district may gain more funds through licensing fee it may charge privately established institutions in their district, through central grants, and land sales. All the curriculum must be set by the states themself, but if the state opts in to accept the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) as their Curriculum, they must be granted central funds as well.
- These districts would be governed by a board, elected by the parents of the students who attends schools in respective districts, instead of bureaucratic government, or by legislatures.
- CBSE is to be reformed to focus much more than now, on moral/ethical values, work ethic, strong character development, stakeholder capitalism, and financial education to instill values such as saving, spending, debt management and compulsory education involving things like changing world order, and a fictional book every school year, such as 1984 for last year of school, and harry potter series for middle school.
- Install and Promote not only NATIONAL CADET CORPS but Boy Scouts, and Girl Scouts in private schools, encouraging every able bodied student to participate.

### Management of Debt of Indian Government and Reducing the Fear of crowding out

- Introduction of Employee Retirement Plan Program, based on 401(k) in the U.S. to provide tax free RETIREMENT accounts for the employees, and tax-deductible for employers, from which funds can be transferred to Universities or Technical Colleges to pay for fee of their children; Where the employee must have the freedom to choose their own provider, instead of the company being the one to choose it; The employee or employer won't have influence in how the money is invested, which would be invested in various indexes, mutual funds, and government bonds, but no individual security, except for government securities; Where government bonds must consist of at-least 30% of total holdings, by the provider.
- Making it easier for Non-Resident Indians to deposit funds into Indian Banks or invest into Indian Markets, or Government.
- Permitting manufacturing enterprises to hold up-to $1 for every $100 they earn in foreign currency to reliably be able to import inputs.

### Establishment of National Land Bank

Permitting private enterprises to lease federal land, not otherwise reserved, or being used, for setting up manufacturing enterprises, for term of 50Y to 90Y.

## Why read fiction?

Some [studies have suggested]([https://hbr.org/2020/03/the-case-for-reading-fiction#:~:text=Recent research in neuroscience suggests,the root of the EQ.)](https://hbr.org/2020/03/the-case-for-reading-fiction#:~:text=Recent%20research%20in%20neuroscience%20suggests,the%20root%20of%20the%20EQ.\)) that reading fiction can increase empathy. But a perhaps [even more surprising finding](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2013.783735#:~:text=Original%20Articles-,Opening%20the%20Closed%20Mind%3A%20The%20Effect%20of%20Exposure%20to,on%20the%20Need%20for%20Closure&text=The%20need%20for%20cognitive%20closure,to%20decreased%20creativity%20and%20rationality) comes from researchers who discovered a short-term decrease in the need for “cognitive closure” in the minds of readers of fiction. In brief, the researchers write, those with a high need for cognitive closure “need to reach a quick conclusion in decision-making and an aversion to ambiguity and confusion,” and thus, when confronted with confusing circumstances, tend to seize on fast explanations and hang on to them. That generally means they’re more susceptible to things like conspiracy theories and poor information, and they become less rational in their thinking. Reading fiction, though, studies have found, tends to retrain the brain to stay open, comfortable with ambiguity, and able to sort through information more carefully. ~ [https://www.vox.com/even-better/23269893/start-reading-ritual-books](https://www.vox.com/even-better/23269893/start-reading-ritual-books)

## Indian Industrialization

Utilize the USD 800 upper limit set by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to sell the goods in the American market duty free, exporting goods from India.~ [https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/know-before-you-visit/customs-duty-information](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/know-before-you-visit/customs-duty-information).

Sell goods which are being sold at minimal profits, or losses in India, to the U.S. market to cover costs, do R&D and make profits, instead of selling just in one market (Not necessarily USD 800).

## **The Charisma Myth Book notes**

- The equation that produces charisma is actually fairly simple. All you have to do is give the impression that you possess both high power and high warmth, since charismatic behaviors project a combination of these two qualities. “Fight or flight?” is the power question. “Friend or foe?” is the warmth question.
    
- IN THE TORRID London summer of 1886, William Gladstone was up against Benjamin Disraeli for the post of prime minister of the United Kingdom. This was the Victorian era, so whoever won was going to rule half the world. In the very last week before the election, both men happened to take the same young woman out to dinner. Naturally, the press asked her what impressions the rivals had made. She said, “After dining with Mr. Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest person in England. But after dining with Mr. Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest person in England.”
    
    Guess who won the election? It was the man who made others feel intelligent, impressive, and fascinating: Benjamin Disraeli.
    
- Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences.
    
    Reduce how quickly and how often you nod.
    
    Pause for two full seconds before you speak.
    
- The very next time you’re in a conversation, try to regularly check whether your mind is fully engaged or whether it is wandering elsewhere (including preparing your next sentence). Aim to bring yourself back to the present moment as often as you can by focusing on your breath or your toes for just a second, and then get back to focusing on the other person.
    
- Being charismatic does not depend on how much time you have but on how fully present you are in each interaction. The ability to be fully present makes you stand out from the crowd; it makes you memorable. When you’re fully present, even a five-minute conversation can create a “wow” effect, as well as an emotional connection. The people you’re with feel that they have your full attention and that they are the most important thing in the world to you at that moment.
    
- Being seen as powerful means being perceived as able to affect the world around us, whether through influence on or authority over others, large amounts of money, expertise, intelligence, sheer physical strength, or high social status. We look for clues of power in someone’s appearance, in others’ reaction to this person, and, most of all, in the person’s body language.
    
- Warmth, simply put, is goodwill toward others. Warmth tells us whether or not people will want to use whatever power they have in our favor. Being seen as warm means being perceived as any of the following: benevolent, altruistic, caring, or willing to impact our world in a positive way. Warmth is assessed almost entirely through body language and behavior; it’s evaluated more directly than power.
    
- Throughout our interactions, we instinctively look for clues with which to evaluate warmth or power, and then we adjust our assumptions accordingly. Expensive clothing leads us to assume wealth, friendly body language leads us to assume good intentions, a confident posture leads us to assume the person has something to be confident about. In essence, people will tend to accept whatever you project.
    
- Disraeli was also projecting power. He, too, had a history of political power, impressive wit, and keen intelligence. But Disraeli’s genius was his ability to make whomever he was speaking with feel intelligent and fascinating. He projected presence and warmth in addition to power and was handsomely rewarded for it.
    
- Words carry lesser weight when compared to body language. In the scope of human evolution, language is a relatively recent invention. But we’ve been interacting well before this through nonverbal modes of communication. As a result, nonverbal communication is hardwired into our brains, much deeper than the more recent language-processing abilities. This is why nonverbal communication has a far greater impact.
    
- Without our realizing it, our bodies send out thousands of signals every minute. Just like our breath and heartbeat, these signals are part of the millions of bodily functions controlled not by our conscious mind but by our subconscious mind. There is far too much body language for us to control consciously.
    
- Putting It into Practice:
    
    Responsibility Transfer
    
    Sit comfortably or lie down, relax, and close your eyes.
    
    Take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing clean air toward the top of your head. As you exhale, let that air whoosh through you, washing away all worries and concerns. Pick an entity—God, Fate, the Universe, whatever may best suit your beliefs—that you could imagine as benevolent. Imagine lifting the weight of everything you’re concerned about—this meeting, this interaction, this day—off your shoulders and placing it on the shoulders of whichever entity you’ve chosen. They’re in charge now.
    
    Visually lift everything off your shoulders and feel the difference as you are now no longer responsible for the outcome of any of these things. Everything is taken care of. You can sit back, relax, and enjoy whatever good you can find along the way.
    
    The next time you feel yourself considering alternative outcomes to a situation, pay close attention. If your brain is going around in circles, obsessing about possible outcomes, try a responsibility transfer to alleviate some of the anxiety. Consider that there might be an all-powerful entity—the Universe, God, Fate—and entrust it with all the worries on your mind.
    
- When our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we’re under attack. Because our brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response.
    
- If you’ve just lost a key client, for instance, think of someone you know—a mentor you have a high regard for, or a colleague you respect—who suffered a similar setback. Imagine them going through this experience. Of course, hearing them tell you their tale of woe in person would be ideal, but even simply imagining them going through this experience and telling you about it can be very helpful. (Remember, your brain won’t know the difference.)
    
- Putting It into Practice:
    
    Destigmatizing Discomfort The next time an uncomfortable emotion is bothering you, try this step-by-step guide to destigmatizing:
    
    Remember that uncomfortable emotions are normal, natural, and simply a legacy of our survival instincts. We all experience them from time to time.
    
    Dedramatize: this is a common part of human experience that happens every day. Think of others who’ve gone through this before, especially people you admire. See it as one burden shared by many. You are part of a community of human beings experiencing this one feeling at this very moment.
    
- There are many positive elements Mary’s mind could focus on. Her client says he’s a big fan of hers, her work is “brilliant,” and he wants her to handle all of his company’s projects. Mary’s mind could spend the next few hours reveling in her client’s praises, but that’s not how most minds work. Despite the high positive-to-negative ratio, what does Mary’s mind focus on? The one negative element: the fact that Jim’s boss hadn’t been impressed with her when they first met. If Mary gets stuck focusing on the one negative in a very positive scenario, you can imagine how unfortunate this could be for her confidence level, and thus her charisma level, when pitching day comes around.
    
- Putting It into Practice: Neutralizing Negativity Use the techniques below anytime you’d like to lessen the effects of persistent negative thoughts. As you try each technique, pay attention to which ones work best for you and keep practicing them until they become instinctive. You may also discover some of your own that work just as well. ♦ Don’t assume your thoughts are accurate. Just because your mind comes up with something doesn’t necessarily mean it has any validity. Assume you’re missing a lot of elements, many of which could be positive. ♦ See your thoughts as graffiti on a wall or as little electrical impulses flickering around your brain. ♦ Assign a label to your negative experience: self-criticism, anger, anxiety, etc. Just naming what you are thinking and feeling can help you neutralize it. ♦ Depersonalize the experience. Rather than saying “I’m feeling ashamed,” try “There is shame being felt.” Imagine that you’re a scientist observing a phenomenon: “How interesting, there are self-critical thoughts arising.” ♦ Imagine seeing yourself from afar. Zoom out so far, you can see planet Earth hanging in space. Then zoom in to see your continent, then your country, your city, and finally the room you’re in. See your little self, electrical impulses whizzing across your brain. One little being having a particular experience at this particular moment. ♦ Imagine your mental chatter as coming from a radio; see if you can turn down the volume, or even just put the radio to the side and let it chatter away. ♦ Consider the worst-case outcome for your situation. Realize that whatever it is, you’ll survive. ♦ Think of all the previous times when you felt just like this—that you wouldn’t make it through—and yet clearly you did.
    

## Vertical Integrations

> The problem was, you can sell a company software, but you can’t force them to use it to its fullest extent.

> But what if you owned the company?

> Owning the manufacturing plants would solve the issue he faced at Ento: if he ran the place, he could force his employees to use various pieces of software that would help them run the businesses more efficiently. With improved EBITDA across a previously-fragmented portfolio of small shops, he could eventually turn around, sell the portfolio to a larger private equity fund or strategic buyer, rinse, wash, and repeat.

Vertical integration is typically the dominant strategy when industries are in their early stages or undergoing significant transformation, when market structures are unclear, supply chains are underdeveloped, and new technologies are emerging. Companies that can control more of the value chain can introduce new products that the market needs faster and more efficiently.

As industries mature, modularization typically prevails. It allows for specialization, flexibility, and cost efficiency. Companies typically focus on specific parts of the value chain, and rely on partners for the rest.

Then, the system gets increasingly complex and fragile over time, and is unable to respond to changing conditions quickly enough, necessitating a new wave of vertical integration.

## An Empire of Wealth: t**he epic history of American economic power**

> With no need to maintain a large and expensive army, England was a low-tax state for much of its history, able to put its economic resources into developing more resources. Further, it could afford the luxury of decentralized government; the running of local affairs was left in the hands of local people with little interference from the king. And England had the most fluid social structure of any major nation in Europe. While it had an aristocracy—aindeed one legendary for its wealth and influence—it had no closed noble class. Marriage alliances between successful bourgeois families and landed families have always been far more common in Britain than on the Continent, and talent could thus rise much more easily to the top. Napoleon’s description of England as a nation of shopkeepers was meant as an insult. It was taken as a compliment.

> Geopolitically, that situation resembled England’s, only on a much grander scale. Until the second half of the twentieth century, North America was largely immune from foreign attack, and the hand of government (and thus the tax man) lay very lightly indeed upon it for most of that time. And just as Great Britain was perfectly situated on the map to dominate the trade routes of northern Europe as that area began to dominate European and world affairs, the United States was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the emergence of a fully globalized economy. The United States is the only Great Power to front on both the Atlantic and the Pacific and the only one whose national territory sprawls across arctic, temperate, and tropical climate zones. It is at once both effectively an island, with all of an island’s military security, and a continent, with all of a continent’s resources.

> Further, most of the people who came to what is now the United States—by no means all of them English, of course—came here precisely to be able to run their own affairs as they saw fit, both to worship their God and to better their economic situation in what has been seen for centuries as a land of opportunity. It is perhaps not a coincidence that the United States is both the most religious nation on earth and the most secular, the most devout and the most commercial.
